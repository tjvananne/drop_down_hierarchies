# Closing Code Drop Down Hierarchy

This is my first real javascript project.
Eventually, I'd like this to be an electron
application, but for now, I have plenty to
learn and test in a raw javascript environment
in the browser/DOM before moving forward.


## POC #1
I need to make sure that I can manually format
the JSON string / object correctly and can
generate the hierarchical drop downs from just
that manually crafted JSON. Once that is 
complete, then I think I should be able to 
look into how to go about writing functions
to insert and delete objects from the JSON at 
particular subsets of the objects.


## POC #1 Learnings:

* How to structure valid JSON
* How to parse and stringify JSON
* `Object.keys()` to list out the names of the object
* loop through properties with `for(prop in obj)`
* programmatically create options and add them to
select objects
* JavaScript script placement inside of html, the
elements have to already be loaded for getElementById
to work properly?
