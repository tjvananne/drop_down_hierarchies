# drop_down_hierarchies
This is me experimenting with some front-end (and potentially back end if I get into node) javascript. My goal is to drive a dynamic dropdown hierarchy with JSON that can be stringified and parsed as necessary. The user also has the ability to create and delete elements in the hierarchy from the web UI.
